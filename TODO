- why is y declared outside IIFE function in compilation of x = (y * 2 for y in z)? is that correct/desirable?
- why does y = (x for x in [0..a]) generate ref?
- does x for [0..3] by y double-declare ref?
  - same for 0 for [1..2] double-declaring i

- should localize generation of comment inside catch block?
