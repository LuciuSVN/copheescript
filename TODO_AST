- directives
- check makeReturn() more thoroughly eg is ctor.body.makeReturn() desirable when generating AST?
- should test that all expected errors (that would occur when compiling) occur when generating AST
- location data for ClassMethod for static method should include @
- seems like StringLiteral extra.raw shouldn't have some of the escaping done that makeDelimitedLiteral() does? eg for a string with a backslash line continuation?
- should update to OptionalCallExpression/OptionalMemberExpression? Is that where babel 7 landed?
